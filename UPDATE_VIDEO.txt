HOW TO UPDATE VIDEOS:

On this website, the only html files that contain videos are:

about.html
Index.html
login.html

To change the pre-existing videos on “about.html”, “index.html” and “login”, follow these steps:

1. Upload the mp4 clip you want to display
2. Open the html file of whichever page you want to replace the video of
3. Ctrl + f: video controls
4. You should see 5 lines of code that look like this:
    <video controls>
        <source src="movie1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="movie1.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Video Unavailable.
    </video>
5. Switch out the strings “movie1.mp4” AND “movie1.ogg” to match the name of the mp4 file you uploaded in step 1
6. ONLY edit the strings that say “movie1.mp4” AND “movie1.ogg”
7. DO NOT EDIT ANY OTHER LINES OF CODE
8. Save the updated document and reload the website
9. The new video should be playing on all the pages you edited
